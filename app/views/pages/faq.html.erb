  <h4 id="what-is-openfarm">What is OpenFarm? <a href="#what-is-openfarm"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a></h4>
  <p>
  OpenFarm is a website where <em>you</em> learn how to grow things.
  </p>
  <p>
  We use user-created guides that detail how to grow a wide variety of crops so you can decide what the best way of growing a something is.
  </p>
  <p>
  Think of it as recipes for awesome plants in your yard, greenhouse, windowsill, or anywhere.
  </p>
  <h4 id="how-can-i-help">Can I help you? <a href="#how-can-i-help"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a></h4>
  <p>
  Short answer: <strong>Yes!</strong></p>
  <p>
  Long answer: Development is quick and constantly changing. We're pushing things at least a couple of times a week, and for that reason, anything that changes is up for debate and re-consideration.
  </p>
  <p>
  Right now the focus of the project is on guide creation (Growing Guides). However, for that to work properly, we need real plant data(Crops).

  <h4 id="who">Who makes OpenFarm? <a href="#who"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a></h4>
  <p>
  You!
  </p>
  <p>
  Seriously, OpenFarm is only possible because users are creating guides, tracking their gardens, and writing the actual software.
  </p>
  <p>
  If you're interested in helping out with any of these things, join <a href="http://slack.openfarm.cc">our slack room</a>, or say hi: <a href="mailto:hi@openfarm.cc">hi@openfarm.cc</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  <p>
  But we've also got a fairly large group of regular contributors who have done more than their fair share. Have a look at our <a href="/pages/about">about page</a> to learn more about these wonderful people.

  Currently most day-to-day discussion happens in our Slack group <strong>which anyone is free to join</strong>. You can add yourself by <a href="http://slack.openfarm.cc/">joining it</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  A couple of us hang out on #farmbot and #openfarm on IRC, though it's not very active. A bot to ping things back and forth is being thought about, but if you want to take initiative, please do!
  </p>
  <p>
  If you don't believe in Slack's ability to destroy e-mail (don't worry, we don't either), you can also send us a quick e-mail at <a href="mailto:hi@openfarm.cc">hi@openfarm.cc</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
  A couple of us hang out on #openfarm on freenode, though it's not very active. A bot for pinging has been discussed.

  <h4 id="farmbot">How is this related to Farmbot? <a href="#farmbot"><i class="fa fa-link"></i></a></h4>
  <p>
  Only in that some of us work on both projects.
  Farmbot will eventually use the OpenFarm API, but the two projects are very distinct.
  </p>
  <p>
  This also goes for the Slack channel.

      <p>
        &#8220;Soil is the mixture of minerals, organic matter, gases, liquids, and the myriad of organisms that together support plant life. It is a natural body that exists as part of the pedosphere and which performs four important functions: it is a medium for plant growth; it is a means of water storage, supply and purification; it is a modifier of the atmosphere; and it is a habitat for organisms that take part in decomposition of organic matter and the creation of a habitat for new organisms.&#8221; - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil">Wikipedia</a>
