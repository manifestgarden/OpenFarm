  # Warning! This is a _bit_ of hack. Because delayed_job_shallow_mongoid
  # does a find() on StageAction when trying to add anything to it, it seems
  # and StageAction is an embedded instance, it can't actually find
  # a StageAction for the ID, because it's not looking in the right place
  # So instead we overwrite the find function to locate the stage action
  # within all stages.
  def self.find(id)
    return nil if id.nil? || id.blank?

    id = BSON::ObjectId.from_string(id) if id.is_a?(String)
