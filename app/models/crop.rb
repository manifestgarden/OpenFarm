      # need to add an extra build step to populate S3 and then add conditional
      # logic to figure out which class its embedded in to return the correct
      # URL.

      # If someone reading this has a better idea, I'd love to hear it. In the
      # meantime, I'm willing to look the other way and violate MVC in favor of
      # having less code to maintain. The current solution lets us keep the file
      # in source control instead of expecting the developer to upload it to an
      # S3 bucket when setting up new boxes.
